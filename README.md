# Messi Outlier

We explore Lionel Messi's career through **data analysis and visualization**. We aim to examine whether Lionel Messi stands out as a statistical outlier in football history.

## Repository Structure

-   `data/` → sample datasets or links (large data will not be stored here).
-   `notebooks/` → this is meant for Exploration. Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.
-   `src/` → this is meant for clean reusable Python scripts (data loading, plotting, utils).
-   `figs/` → exported charts and visualizations.

## To collaborate:

1.  **Clone the repo**: \`\`\`bash git clone <https://github.com/AndresDeve/Messi-outlier.git> cd Messi-outlier

**note:** Since this is a small two-people project, we may both push directly to main. For bigger changes, we might create a feature branch and then open a Pull Request.
